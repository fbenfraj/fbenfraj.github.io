Hello! I'm Farouk Ben Fraj, a dedicated and dynamic Tech Lead & Software Engineer with extensive experience in full-stack development. My journey in the tech world has been marked by a consistent drive towards mastering and innovating with cutting-edge technologies like Typescript, ReactJS, and NodeJS.

### Professional Path

My professional story is one of continuous evolution and a deep commitment to excellence. Starting as a Fullstack React/Node.js Developer at CapGemini, I honed my skills in creating responsive, blockchain-based solutions and played a pivotal role in developing user-centric applications. This foundational experience paved the way for my subsequent roles at the Ministry of the Interior and Trusk, where I further refined my expertise in backend development and system administration.

In my current position as a Tech Lead at RATP, I steer complex technical projects, including the development of a comprehensive management application for RATP host staff. My role involves not only technical acumen but also leadership in guiding a team of programmers towards innovation and excellence. A notable part of my job is ensuring smooth user experiences, facilitated through the use of technologies like AWS, Material-UI, and Docker.

### Entrepreneurial Ventures

My entrepreneurial spirit led me to co-found Raisponse, a unique platform that combines AI with effective communication tools. As the Lead Frontend Developer, I'm responsible for crafting a seamless user interface using ReactJS and Electron, while integrating OpenAI's API for advanced language processing.

### Passion for Web3 and Blockchain

The burgeoning field of Web3 and blockchain technology is another area where I have made significant strides. At FrajTech, I specialize in developing blockchain solutions, engaging with decentralized file storage systems, and working on NFT marketplace projects. My experience in this domain is underpinned by my ability to translate complex client requirements into robust technical specifications.

### Education and Continuous Learning

My academic background includes a Master of Software Architecture and Application Development from EPITECH Paris and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from Paris Descartes University. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and actively keep myself updated with the latest trends in technology.
